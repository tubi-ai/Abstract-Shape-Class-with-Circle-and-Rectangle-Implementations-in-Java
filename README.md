This title captures the essence of the code, which defines an abstract class Shape and provides concrete implementations for two specific shapes: Circle and Rectangle. The code showcases object-oriented principles such as abstraction, inheritance, and encapsulation in Java. The Shape class defines a common interface for calculating area and circumference, while the Circle and Rectangle classes provide specific implementations of these methods.
